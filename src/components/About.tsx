        <p>
          I'm a TGC-taught developer based in Istanbul with a strong interest in front-end technologies, UI/UX design, and clean code. I enjoy solving real-world problems with simple, elegant solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started coding in high school and have since had experience with multiple coding languages. When I'm not coding, you'll find me playing guitar or jokes on myself since my whole life is a joke.
